I am an Experienced Software Developer with a demonstrated history of working in the information technology and services industry.
Before opting to create My own business, I, (a cofounder of BitApps Technology) with an MS in Computer Science, worked for three other Addis Ababa-based companies. Despite having many positive and wonderful interactions, I was dissatisfied with the workflow and the caliber of the output I was producing.
