I am an Experienced Software Developer with a demonstrated history of working in the information technology and services industry.
Before opting to create My own business, I, (a cofounder of BitApps Technology) with an MS in Computer Science, worked for three other Addis Ababa-based companies. Despite having many positive and wonderful interactions, I was dissatisfied with the workflow and the caliber of the output I was producing.
I was certain that I could create and execute effective apps specifically targeted to the demands of the Ethiopian business community and put the information I had gained from my previous work experience and education to greater use.
I thus made the decision to leave my managerial/software lead role and launch my own tech firm with my partner in late 2021.
